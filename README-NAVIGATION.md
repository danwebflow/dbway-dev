# DixonBaxi Way - Navigation Controls Implementation

This document provides instructions for implementing the updated navigation controls for The DixonBaxi Way website.

## Files Updated

1. **controls.js** - Updated to handle season navigation controls
2. **functions.js** - Enhanced video navigation functions (videoplay, videoend, videoprev)
3. **tabs.js** - Optimized tab switching functionality
4. **navigation.js** (NEW) - Dedicated file for season navigation
5. **passive-touch.js** (NEW) - Makes touchstart events passive by default for better performance

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Add the navigation.js file

Upload the new `navigation.js` file to your server in the same directory as your other JavaScript files.

### 2. Include the new JavaScript files in your HTML

Add the following script tags to your HTML file, just before the closing `</body>` tag:

```html
<script src="/navigation.js"></script>
<script src="/passive-touch.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, you can run the `add-navigation-script.js` script once to automatically add the navigation script to your page.

**Important Note about passive-touch.js**: This script makes all touchstart events passive by default, which improves scrolling performance and eliminates Chrome warnings. However, if you have touchstart events that need to call `preventDefault()`, you must explicitly set `passive: false` in the event listener options.

### 3. Update existing files

Replace the following files with their updated versions:

- controls.js
- functions.js
- tabs.js

### 4. Add navigation buttons to your HTML

Make sure your HTML includes navigation buttons with the appropriate classes:

```html
<!-- Season navigation buttons -->
<button id="prevBtn" class="season-prev">Previous Season</button>
<button id="nextBtn" class="season-next">Next Season</button>
```

You can use any of these class combinations for the navigation buttons:

- `#prevBtn` or `.season-prev` or `.prev-season` or `.season-nav-prev` for previous season
- `#nextBtn` or `.season-next` or `.next-season` or `.season-nav-next` for next season

## Features Added

1. **Enhanced Season Navigation**

   - Next/Previous buttons work with multiple button class options
   - Keyboard navigation (left/right arrow keys)
   - Touch swipe support (if Hammer.js is available)

2. **Improved Video Navigation**

   - Better handling of videos across different seasons
   - Automatic season switching when navigating to videos in other seasons
   - Enhanced error handling for video playback

3. **Performance Optimization**

   - Passive touch events for better scrolling performance
   - Elimination of Chrome warnings about passive event listeners
   - Improved mobile experience with smoother interactions

4. **Debugging Support**
   - Detailed console logging for easier troubleshooting
   - Graceful fallbacks when videos can't be found

## Testing

After implementation, test the following:

1. Season navigation using buttons
2. Season navigation using keyboard arrows
3. Season navigation using touch swipes (on mobile)
4. Video playback within the same season
5. Video navigation across different seasons
6. Auto-advancing to the next video when one ends

## Troubleshooting

If navigation isn't working:

1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify that all script files are properly loaded
3. Ensure the navigation buttons have the correct IDs or classes
4. Check that the season panels have the correct structure and classes

For any issues, refer to the detailed console logs which will help identify where the problem is occurring.
