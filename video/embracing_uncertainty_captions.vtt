00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.220
Mm.

2
00:00:00.505 --> 00:00:04.525
But what I'd definitely say is embracing uncertainty

3
00:00:05.665 --> 00:00:10.285
is really important because when everyone is looking towards

4
00:00:10.285 --> 00:00:13.165
that end goal, they try and solve it in, in day one.

5
00:00:13.705 --> 00:00:16.885
And it does take time to, to create the clear ideas

6
00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:18.565
or to create the unique ideas.

7
00:00:19.305 --> 00:00:21.765
And that is a process and it's a team process.

8
00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.005
So you need to come up with loads of really,

9
00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.965
really bad ideas to get a good idea.

10
00:00:27.225 --> 00:00:29.085
And it's quite nice at that first stage that,

11
00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:31.205
like you were saying, the sort of unfinished part,

12
00:00:31.205 --> 00:00:32.965
like it doesn't have to be like a final thing,

13
00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:35.525
so you can just sketch stuff out and like mm-hmm.

14
00:00:35.845 --> 00:00:37.165
I don't know about you guys, but I always

15
00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:39.205
grew up like doodling. So sort.

16
00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:41.245
Well I guess this has kind of made its way,

17
00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:42.355
Yeah. This has made its

18
00:00:42.355 --> 00:00:43.805
way that's made its way.

19
00:00:44.885 --> 00:00:48.045
I don't think that this made it, this turned into something.

20
00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:52.085
I'm not really sure what that is, ocean door,

21
00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:55.285
That, but mm-hmm.

22
00:00:55.665 --> 00:00:57.645
Motion doodles, dunno. Yeah.

23
00:00:57.665 --> 00:00:59.885
And I think something important that you said, Dan,

24
00:00:59.885 --> 00:01:00.925
is knowing when to stop.

25
00:01:00.955 --> 00:01:04.165
Like, I feel like it's really great in that kind

26
00:01:04.165 --> 00:01:07.125
of ideation phase when you can just make and make and make,

27
00:01:07.385 --> 00:01:09.565
but also knowing that because you're unrestricted on

28
00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:10.965
what you can make, it's good

29
00:01:10.965 --> 00:01:13.205
to like pause and then just move on. Definitely.

30
00:01:13.425 --> 00:01:15.725
And just like, you've gotta bounce on, it's like, okay,

31
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:18.645
just get my thoughts down however.

32
00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:21.365
Mm-hmm. You know, and then it's like, okay, there's,

33
00:01:21.515 --> 00:01:23.925
I've just about managed to capture what I want to.

34
00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:26.845
Mm-hmm. Or at least show the intent of where I want

35
00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:28.965
to take it and then move on.

36
00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:31.325
I think it's like the unfinished part as well is

37
00:01:32.555 --> 00:01:34.525
when is anything ever finished? Yeah. Really

38
00:01:35.235 --> 00:01:39.485
With the, um, the M-T-V-V-M-A stuff, the,

39
00:01:39.585 --> 00:01:42.605
so those giant billboards are anamorphic

40
00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:44.765
and they have to be set up in a very particular

41
00:01:44.825 --> 00:01:45.925
way to get perspective.

42
00:01:46.865 --> 00:01:50.485
And we didn't have the information we needed to set that up.

43
00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:51.845
Right. Because it's very technical

44
00:01:52.985 --> 00:01:54.365
and there was talk of like, okay,

45
00:01:54.365 --> 00:01:56.645
maybe we just use those screens, but we use them flat.

46
00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:58.765
Um, and then Victor, one

47
00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:00.845
of the motion designers was just adamant, he was like,

48
00:02:00.885 --> 00:02:02.485
I don't want my work to be done flat

49
00:02:02.485 --> 00:02:03.565
when it could be so much better.

50
00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:05.885
Yeah. I mean the, the thing with the screens

51
00:02:05.905 --> 00:02:10.565
and the VMA, like the, the client was like, okay,

52
00:02:10.565 --> 00:02:11.805
we have all of these screens

53
00:02:12.385 --> 00:02:15.005
and they have used them in the past for, uh,

54
00:02:15.215 --> 00:02:17.605
other VMA, uh, projects.

55
00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:19.445
So like, okay, this is my chance.

56
00:02:19.665 --> 00:02:21.445
You, you don't really get that many chances

57
00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:22.925
as a motion designer to do that.

58
00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:25.525
And it turned out it's a lot harder than I thought it was.

59
00:02:26.585 --> 00:02:31.045
Uh, obviously. And I had to do all sort of things for that.

60
00:02:31.115 --> 00:02:34.805
Like, at first you have to build like the actual space

61
00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:36.845
where the billboard leaves in 3D

62
00:02:36.845 --> 00:02:39.205
with like super accurate measurements.

63
00:02:39.555 --> 00:02:42.965
Then you have to place the camera at the exact distance

64
00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:45.165
where the person will be seeing it at like the

65
00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.485
average human height.

66
00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:49.005
And yeah, that was a long process.

67
00:02:49.945 --> 00:02:53.205
And then you just like make the animation in 3D

68
00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:54.965
and then you flatten it.

69
00:02:55.185 --> 00:02:58.685
And when I flatten it, it looked so messed up

70
00:02:58.745 --> 00:02:59.745
Better. So he

71
00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.605
researched, tried to get

72
00:03:01.605 --> 00:03:02.685
as much information as he did.

73
00:03:02.685 --> 00:03:04.325
We went back to the client like, can you try

74
00:03:04.325 --> 00:03:05.885
and push from your end, get us the spec.

75
00:03:06.505 --> 00:03:09.685
And so sometimes just letting that ambition

76
00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:10.925
and letting yourself,

77
00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:14.165
or knowing yourself how good it can be if you really push it

78
00:03:14.165 --> 00:03:16.685
and just letting that drive you can just really help kind

79
00:03:16.685 --> 00:03:19.685
of, you know, a time constraint, the technical constraints

80
00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:21.965
and you know, sometimes those things do limit you,

81
00:03:21.985 --> 00:03:24.005
but you know, you've gotta try pushing 'em first

82
00:03:24.005 --> 00:03:25.245
because you never quite know.

83
00:03:25.545 --> 00:03:28.005
And ultimately it turned out looking f*****g awesome.

84
00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:32.405
Very cool. So it was a big gamble and it paid off.
